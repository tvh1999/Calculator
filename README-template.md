## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate correctly

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - TypeScript

### What I learned

This project is my first attempt at familiar myself with TypeScript along with github and tailwind. The logic part itself is not really hard but with the appearance of Next.js and TS actually makes things more complicated than it needs to be.

Also regarding eval. You must use it in indirect style. If you use it directly then it will slow down the whole program.

I am fully aware that the use of Next.js in this type of project is overkill and is not needed, but I personally think this is a perfect project for someone who is still lack in experience like me.

### Useful resources

- [Rem or Pixels?](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/surprising-truth-about-pixels-and-accessibility/) - This blog helped me to use the correct units in styling. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [App router?](https://vercel.com/blog/common-mistakes-with-the-next-js-app-router-and-how-to-fix-them) - This is an amazing document which helped me finally understand the common pitfalls when handling with app router. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [Tailwind Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - if you use tailwind then you will need to know about this docs of course.
- [React + TS cheatsheet](https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app/) - It makes the process of finding what I need much more easier. TS offical docs is not really well written to be honest.
